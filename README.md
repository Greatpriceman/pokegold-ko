POKEMON GOLD & SILVER, Korean Localizations

This repository is supposed to build the following roms

Pocket Monsters Geum (Korea).gbc (Gold Version) ``MD5: 7B2A826A910A8E55EA0F8D489A2E8D99``

Pocket Monsters Eun (Korea).gbc (Silver Version) ``MD5: 9B09942F728DF561C3921167BD566F9C``

there is no way to build a rom yet, as it will need further disassembly and labeling.

others are free to help out with said further disassembly and editing as long as the rom is the same.

The baseroms needed are the ones listed, plus compare differences between English versions and Korean versions.
