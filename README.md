POKEMON GOLD & SILVER, Korean Localizations

This repository is supposed to build the following roms

Pocket Monsters Geum (Korea).gbc (Gold Version) ``MD5: 7B2A826A910A8E55EA0F8D489A2E8D99``

Pocket Monsters Eun (Korea).gbc (Silver Version) ``MD5: 9B09942F728DF561C3921167BD566F9C``

there is no way to build a rom yet, as it will need further disassembly and labeling.

others are free to help out with said further disassembly and editing as long as the rom is the same.
